                        <p>Yesterday, I went to the store and got some much needed spatulas!

                        <h2>04/08/08: Cookie Cupcakes</h2>
                        <p>My favorite cartoon character is Cookie, and my favorite dessert is cupcakes. So Cookie Cupcakes are best of both worlds! Did you know Cookie once said,
                        <span class="text">“Sometimes me think what is love, and then me think love is what cookie is for.”</span>
                        I wonder if the same applies for cupcakes!</p>
